# Project Explainer: Multi-Spectral Band Visualization Before Cloud Detection

## üåç Overview
This project demonstrates how to visualize and process multi-spectral satellite data to extract insights, focusing particularly on RGB and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) composites, followed by a simple but effective cloud detection method. It aims to show how clouds affect land analysis and how masking them can enhance interpretation.

## üì• Dataset
We work with five satellite scenes, each stored as a `.npy` NumPy array containing multiple bands of Sentinel-2 imagery. Each array includes at least the following bands:

- B02 (Blue)  - Index 1
- B03 (Green) - Index 2
- B04 (Red)   - Index 3
- B08 (NIR)   - Index 7
- B11 (SWIR)  - Index 11

## üéØ Objective
1. Visualize RGB and NDVI composites for all scenes
2. Detect and mask clouds using spectral thresholding
3. Apply the cloud mask to RGB & NDVI
4. Save and export the clean, enhanced visual outputs

## üß™ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### üîπ RGB Composite Visualization
- We extract Red, Green, and Blue bands from each scene.
- Normalize each band individually for better contrast.
- Stack the normalized bands to create a natural-color image.

### üîπ NDVI Calculation
- NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)
- This index highlights vegetation health ‚Äî green areas have high NDVI values.

### üîπ Cloud Detection (Rule-Based)
- Clouds appear bright in visible and NIR, and dark in SWIR.
- We apply this rule:
```python
cloud_mask = (
    (scene[1] > 0.25) &   # Blue
    (scene[2] > 0.25) &   # Green
    (scene[3] > 0.25) &   # Red
    (scene[7] > 0.25) &   # NIR
    (scene[11] < 0.3)     # SWIR
)
```

### üîπ Mask Application
- The boolean mask is applied to RGB and NDVI arrays.
- Cloudy pixels are blacked out (or turned to NaN / 0).

### üîπ Exporting Results
- Each RGB and NDVI output (with/without clouds) is saved as `.png`.
- Images are organized by scene in the `outputs/` folder.

## üìà Insights & Impact
- **Before cloud masking**, NDVI can mislead interpretation in cloudy zones.
- **After cloud masking**, we get cleaner, more reliable vegetation data.
- This process simulates pre-processing workflows used in climate science, forestry, agriculture, and land use analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab (for development)
- Sentinel-2 multi-band data

## üöÄ What I Learned
- Improved handling of multi-spectral datasets
- How band combinations affect imagery
- How simple rules can effectively detect atmospheric obstructions
- Modular, scalable scripting for geospatial workflows
